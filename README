These Classes here are pretty and straight forward. A careful inspection of their methods should tell you what they do.

The test is a good place to check how these things are used in their simplest form

To run tests, please run the SQL scripts in SQL/ first

To start copy all the jars in lib to $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext
run ant all
run ./copyto
run ant test

Enjoy.
